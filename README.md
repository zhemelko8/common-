Early life
Lonnie Rashid Lynn, Jr. was born on March 13, 1972 at the Chicago Osteopathic Hospital in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood, the son of educator Dr. Mahalia Ann Hines and former ABA basketball player turned youth counselor Lonnie Lynn Sr.[6] He was raised in the Calumet Heights neighborhood.[7][8][9][10] Lynn’s parents divorced when he was six years old, resulting in his father moving to Denver, Colorado. This left Lynn to be raised by his mother; however, his father remained active in his life, and was able to get Lynn a job with the Chicago Bulls as a teenager. While a student at Luther High School South in Chicago, Lynn, along with two of his friends formed C.D.R., a rap trio that opened for acts such as N.W.A and Big Daddy Kane.[11]

Lynn attended Florida A&M University for two years under a scholarship and majored in business administration.[12] After being featured in the Unsigned Hype column of The Source magazine, Lynn debuted in 1992 with the single "Take It EZ", followed by the album Can I Borrow a Dollar?, under stage name Common Sense.
